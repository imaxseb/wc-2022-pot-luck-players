# World Cup 2022 Pot Luck Players

## Introduction

This is a World Cup sweepstake but instead of getting a country you get a random selection of players and there are different prizes based how those players perform.

Entry will be £10, with 10 prizes in total. All the entry money is split between the 10 prizes so each prize is equal to the number of people who enter.

For example, if 40 people enter then each prize will be £40.

Each country can have 23-26 players in their squad so with 736-832 total players there is plenty to share.

Every entrant will recieve the same number of players, this means there may be spare players.
