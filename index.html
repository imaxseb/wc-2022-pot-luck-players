<h1>Pot Luck Players World Cup 2022</h1>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>This is a World Cup sweepstake but instead of getting a country you get a random selection of players and there are different prizes based how those players perform.</p>
<p>Entry will be £10, with 10 prizes in total. All the entry money is split between the 10 prizes so each prize is equal to the number of people who enter.</p>
<p>For example, if 40 people enter then each prize will be £40.</p>
<p>Each country can have 23-26 players in their squad so with 736-832 total players there is plenty to share.</p>
<p>Every entrant will recieve the same number of players, this means there may be spare players.</p>
<h2>How to enter</h2>
<p>Send the entry money to confirm your place. Deadline is <b>Saturday 19 November 2022</b>.</p>
<p>The draw will be made on Sunday 20 November, before the first match which kicks off at 16:00.</p>
<p>Players will be assigned and listed below in the Player List section.</p>
